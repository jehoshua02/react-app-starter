# React Scaffold

Couldn't find a Yeoman generator with webpack, react, reflux and react-router.


## Tests

```shell
npm test
```

Coverage reports saved to `coverage/`.


## Build

```shell
npm run build
```

Build output saved in `public/`.


## Watch

```shell
npm run watch
```


## Preview

```shell
open public/index.html
```

(I would love to figure out how to serve and refresh browser on build)
