# React App Starter

Couldn't find a Yeoman generator with webpack, react, reflux, jest and react-router.

There's lots of [others](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=webpack+react+reflux+&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) out there.


## Tasks

These are the build tasks available using `npm run <task>`. Look at `scripts` in
`package.json` to see what they actually do.


### serve

```shell
npm run serve
```


### watch

```shell
npm run watch
```


### build

```shell
npm run build
```

Build output saved in `public/`.


### preview

```shell
npm run preview
```
